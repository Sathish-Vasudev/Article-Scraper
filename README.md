### THE ARTICLE SCRAPER V1.1

This program allows the user to scrape the content from an article in the internet using its URL alone and convert the content into <br/> a MS-Word Document. This program uses the ***newspaper3k*** and ***Python-docx*** library. Be sure to load the modules before using this program or run the ***pre-requisites*** code. This prorgam gives the 
following from an article in the Word Document, <br/>
1. The Title and the URL                                   
2. Content                                                 
3. Top Image of the Article                              
4. Summary of the Article                                
5. Keywords from the Article 

#### INSTRUCTIONS                                            

1. Collect the URLs of the articles you want to obtain and list them one URL per line in a Text file *(*.txt)*.
2. Now, initiate the program. Provide the location or the name of the text file that contains the URLs.                                      
3. Select a set of links to process or select all depending upon your need. Larger number of URLs *(i.e. >30)* <br/> might take longer. So, it is ideal to split and process.      
4. Provide a valid name for your Word Document with the *(*.docx)* extension.                                      
5. Once the process is completed, the title of all the articles processed will be listed, marking the end of the process.                                            

#### NOTE 
If you are running the program for the first time, run the ***prereqs.py*** file before executing the program.
